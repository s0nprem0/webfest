            <p>The COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CEIT) started as the Department of Agricultural
                Engineering in 1976. It offered basic agricultural engineering courses required by the BSA curriculum.</p>
            <p>In 1985, the unit was renamed to Department of Engineering and Agro-Industrial Technology (DEAIT). By virtue
                of Board Resolution No. 5, S1985, it started to offer Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering on the first semester of SY 1985 – 1986.</p>
            <p>In 1992, the department was elevated to the School status. This resulted in the creation of two (2) distinct departments: the Engineering Science Department and the Agricultural Engineering Department. The formation of these departments delineated the basic engineering science courses from the agricultural engineering
                courses.</p>
            <p>In 1993, the Department of Engineering Technology was created. The newly created department offers non-degree
                courses in engineering technology.</p>
            <p>In 1998, when the College was elevated to University status, the School of Engineering (SEng) was
                subsequently elevated to the College level and was named as the College of Engineering (CEng).</p>
            <p>To accommodate IT courses offerings; the College was renamed as the College of Engineering and Information
                Technology (CEIT) in 2001.</p>
            <p>As approved by the Board of Regents, CEIT offers various engineering programs, computer-based programs, and
                industrial technology programs.</p>
