            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p class="description">ELITS, the Elite League of Information Technology Students, represents a vibrant and influential school
                organization within the university. Comprising a diverse group of motivated IT students across different
                academic years, ELITS embodies the credibility of student engagement and leadership. Operating within a
                democratic framework, ELITS boasts a structured committee, with elected positions such as President, Vice
                Presidents, Secretaries, Treasurer, Auditor, Business Manager, GAD Representative, P.R.O, and Representatives.
                This dynamic organization plays a crucial role in fostering a tech-savvy community, aligning with the
                university's IT-driven educational environment.
                As we embark on a new academic year, it is with great pleasure that we introduce our dedicated team of school
                officers for the year ahead. These individuals have been selected to lead and serve our school community, and
                they bring with them a commitment to excellence and a passion for making this year memorable and productive for
                all of us.</p>
